        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Sovrin DID method specification conforms to the requirements specified in the DID specification
           currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group. For more information about DIDs and
           DID method specifications, please see the <a
                    href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md"

        Sovrin is a public ledger designed specifically and only for privacy-preserving
          self-sovereign identity. The Sovrin Ledger is governed by the
        international non-profit <a href="https://www.sovrin.org" target="_blank">Sovrin Foundation</a>.
        As the only public ledger designed exclusively for self-sovereign identity,
        Sovrin is optimized for DIDs and DID Documents. DIDs are created, stored,
        and used with verifiable claims. This specification covers how these DIDs are
        managed. It also describes related features of Sovrin of
        particular interest to DID owners, guardians, and developers.

        <h2>Sovrin DID Method </h2>
        <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>sov</code></p>
        <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:sov</code>.
            Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
            is the NSI specified below.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Target System(s)</h2>
        <p>This DID method applies to the Sovrin network in all its incarnations, beginning with Sovrin's
        provisional launch on 31 July 2017.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h2>
        <p>
          The Sovrin DID scheme is defined by the following <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/std/std68.txt">ABNF</a>:<br><br>
          <code>
            sovrin-did    = "did:sov:" idstring *(":" subnamespace)<br>
            idstring      = 21*22(base58char)<br>
            subnamespace  = ALPHA *(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-")<br>
            base58char          = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" / "A" / "B" / "C"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" / "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" / "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" / "a" / "b" / "c"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" / "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p"<br/>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" / "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"<br>
          </code><br>
          All Sovrin DIDs are base58 encoded using the Bitcoin/IPFS alphabets of a 16-byte uuid.
          The encoding uses most alphas and digits, omitting 0OIl to avoid readability problems. This
            gives an NSI length of either 21 or 22 characters, and it means that DIDs are case-sensitive and may not
            be case-normalized, even though the prefix is always lower-case.<br>
          <br>
          Optional one or more sub namespaces may be specified to indicate which Sovrin system the DID should reference.
          </p>
        <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
        <p>The 16-byte uuid underlying a Sovrin DID can be generated in various ways--using standard uuid methods, for example, or
            by selecting the first 16 bytes of a 256 bit Ed25519 verification key (the public
          portion of the key pair). In the latter case, there may or may not be an active verification
          key for the identity owner; that information is only available in the
          key descriptions in the owner section of the DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>A convenient regex to match <code>sov</code> DIDs is: <br><br>
            <code>^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}$</code><br><br>
           A convenient regex to match the entire did string is:<br><br>
            <code>^did:sov:[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{21,22}(?&lt;namespace&gt;(?::\w[-\w]*)*)$</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>A valid <code>sov</code> DID might be: <code>did:sov:2wJPyULfLLnYTEFYzByfUR</code>.</p>

      <h2>JSON-LD Context Definition</h2>
        <p>On Sovrin, public DIDs and their corresponding documents are stored on the ledger.</p>

        <h2>CRUD Operation Definitions</h2>

        <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
        <p>
            The DID method specification must specify how a client creates a DID record—the combination of a DID and its associated document—on the 
            target system, including all cryptographic operations necessary to establish proof of ownership.
            The Sovrin spec adds a new entry under <code>publicKey</code> called <code>authorizations</code>. 
            This is used to indicate possible authorizations the public key is supposed to have. The keyword <code>ALL</code> means that the public key can make whatever change it wants to the DID doc.
            While creating a new DID doc, the field <code>authorizations</code> cannot be left empty. It has to either contain the keyword <code>ALL</code> or be ommitted, 
            in that case it is assumed that the key has all authorizations.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>To create a DID, you must submit a <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/requests.html#nym">"NYM"</a> transaction that looks like this: <br>
          <pre>
                {
                  'operation': {
                      'type': &lt;Transaction type -- NYM &gt;,
                      'dest': &lt;new DID that is being registered&gt;,
                      'role': &lt;Role given to the new DID -- based on network config&gt;,
                      'verkey': &lt;Key material encoded&gt;,
                  },
                  
                  'identifier': 'L5AD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf' &lt;Trust Anchor DID&gt;,
                  'reqId': &lt;A nonce for this transaction&gt;,
                  'protocolVersion': 2,
                  'signature': &lt;signature over this transaction from the Trust Anchor&gt;
                }

            </pre> The transaction must be signed by a Trust Anchor and must provide an un-registered DID and a document of data
            about that DID. Possible outcomes from the create operation include:
            <ul>
                <li>NACK: "Malformed transaction or missing required fields"</li>
                <li>REJECT: "Authorization rules are invalid. DID already registered or non Trust Anchor authored the transaction or signature did not match”</li>
                <li>SUCCESS: "Contains the sequence number of the transaction and the merkle proof"</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>DID Service Endpoint</h4>

        <p>By convention, Indy DID Controllers often create an Indy ATTRIB object (using the <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/requests.html#attrib">"ATTRIB"</a>
           transaction) related to the NYM with a raw value of "endpoint", and a URL that represents the service endpoint for the DID. As noted in the "Read" section of this specification
           such an "endpoint" ATTRIB is read when resolving a DID and its data included in the resulting DID Document.
        </p>

        <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
        
        <p>A Sovrin DID record can be looked up directly by the DID using a standard Sovrin GET_NYM transaction that simply
            takes the DID and returns the DID record. The client trusts the DID record because it either receives the
            same DID record from sufficient number of validators or it receives a proof of the DID record from a single validator
            that the DID record is part of a merkle tree whose root has an aggregate signature from sufficient number of
            validators.
        </p>
        
        <p>This is what the DID record query looks like</p>
        
        <pre>
                {
                    "submitterId": &lt;Optional; DID of the author of this query&gt;,
                    "reqId": &lt;Optional; a nonce for this query&gt;,
                    "operation": {
                        "did": &lt;DID to be queried&gt;,
                        "type": "GET_NYM"
                    }
                }
        </pre>
        
        <p>Anyone can query a DID record by sending the above request. The response contains the data that can be used to create a DID document, as noted below.</p>

        <h4>DID Service Endpoint</h4>

        <p>When reading (resolving) a Sovrin DID, in addition to querying the DID record, a query MUST be performed for a related DID Service endpoint.
          This is done by executing the <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/requests.html#get_attrib">"GET_ATTRIB"</a>
          transaction. The format of the GET_ATTRIB request looks like 
        </p>

        <pre>
          {
              "submitterId": &lt;Optional; DID of the author of this query&gt;,
              "reqId": &lt;Optional; a nonce for this query&gt;,
              "identifier": &lt;Required; The DID being read/resolved&gt;,
              "operation": {
                "raw": "{\"endpoint\":{\"endpoint\":\"https://example.com\"}}" &lt;Required; the value must be endpoint&gt;
              }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>The result may be a "Not Found" error, indicating the NYM does not have an optional corresponding ATTRIB <tt>endpoint</tt> record.
          If the call is successful, the relevant part of the response of such a GET_ATTRIB request is:</p>

        <pre>
          {
            ...
            'data': '{"endpoint":{"endpoint":"https://example.com/endpoint"}}',
            'dest': 'AH4RRiPR78DUrCWatnCW2w' &lt; The DID being read/resolved&gt;, 
            'raw': 'endpoint',
            ...
          }
        </pre>

        <p>The value of the inner <tt>endpoint</tt> item (<tt>https://example.com/endpoint</tt> in the example above) is the service endpoint for the DID.</p>

        <p>Historically on the Sovrin MainNet (through June 2021), the format of the <tt>endpoint</tt> ATTRIB has been simply a single name ("endpoint") value (a URL) pair, as shown above.    
        An extended version of the <tt>endpoint</tt> ATTRIB MAY be written to an Indy ledger by a DID Controller to provide additional control over the generation of the DID Document.
        The format is as follows:</p>

        <pre>
        {
          "endpoint": "https://example.com",
          "types": [ "endpoint", "did-communication", "DIDComm" ],
          "routingKeys": [ "did:key12345", "did:key12345" ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>This corresponds to the raw value in the "ATTRIB" transaction as:</p>

        <pre>
        "raw": "{\"endpoint\":{\"endpoint\":\"https://example.com\",\"types\":[\"endpoint\",\"did-communication\",\"DIDComm\" ],\"routingKeys\":[\"did:key12345\",\"did:key12345\"]}}"
        </pre>
        
        <p>A <tt>did:sov</tt> resolver MUST process the <tt>endpoint</tt> ATTRIB (extended or not) as follows:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>If the <tt>types</tt> field is present it's entries MUST be <tt>endpoint</tt>, <tt>did-communication</tt> and/or <tt>DIDComm</tt>, generating entries in the DID Document <tt>service</tt> block.</li>
        <ul><li>The three service block formats corresponding to the three types is defined in the next section of this document.</li></ul>
        <li>If the endpoint is defined and the <tt>types</tt> item is NOT present, empty or contains any other values, default the <tt>types</tt> to <tt>"types": [ "endpoint", "did-communication" ]</tt>.</li>
        <ul><li>Any <tt>did:sov</tt> DID wanting to include a DIDComm V2 (<tt>DIDComm</tt>) service entry MUST use the extended version of the "endpoint" ATTRIB with the <tt>types</tt> item included.</li></ul>
        <li>If the <tt>routingKeys</tt> item is present, use its value as the array for <tt>routingKeys</tt> in the <tt>did-communication</tt> and <tt>DIDComm</tt> type service blocks.</li>
        <li>If the <tt>routingKeys</tt> entry is not present, default to the it being an empty array (e.g. <tt>"routingKeys": [ ]</tt>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Resolver DID Document Format</h4>

        <p>The DID Document is generated by a resolver (not by the Indy/Sovrin ledger) by taking the GET_NYM and optional GET_ATTRIB/endpoint data and 
          rendering a DID Document as follows. See the notes following the rendering.
        </p>

        </pre>

        <p>If an <tt>endpoint</tt> ATTRIB does not exist for the NYM, the <tt>service</tt> block is an empty array (e.g. <tt>"service": []</tt></p>

        <p>If the <tt>endpoint</tt> has a <tt>types</tt> item and that <tt>types</tt> item contains an entry <tt>"DIDComm"</tt>,

            "routingKeys": []
          }
        </pre>

        In addition the service block, the following entry needs to be added to the <tt>@context</tt> array:

        <pre>
          "https://didcomm.org/messaging/contexts/v2"
        </pre>

        <h4>DID Document Notes</h4>

        <p>The following are notes about the example DID Document above:
          <ul>
              <li>The DID Document text is boilerplate except for the "did:sov..." identifier, the public keys ("publicKeyBase58" values) and the references to the service endpoint ("serviceEndpoint").</li>
              <li>The X25519 key MUST be derived from the ED25519 key by the resolver. The Indy "GET_NYM" call returns only the ED25519 key.</li>
              <ul><li>Note that although the "keyAgreement" key is included in the DID Document, because of historical conventions it is the ED25519 key referenced in the <tt>recipientKeys</tt> item in the <tt>did-communication</tt> service block.
                The pending "did:indy" DID Method will correct such conventions and provide Indy DID Controller clients with full control over the contents of their DID Documents.
              </li></ul>
              <li>If there is no result from the GET_ATTRIB transaction, the "service" item is NOT included in the document.</li>
              <li>The entries in the service block are included based on the value or absence of the <tt>types</tt> item in the "endpoint" ATTRIB. The three entry formats cover the three "eras" of DIDComm,
                AIP 1.0 (type "endpoint"), AIP 2.0 (type "did-communication") and DIDComm V2 (type "DIDComm").

        <h3>Update (Replace)</h3>
        <p>To replace the DID document, the owner or guardian (guardianship ends once ownership begins) of the DID should send the following
            transaction using a key referenced in the <strong>authentication</strong> property.

                <br/>
                This example shows how to update the DID document to require multiple signatures for authentication:

                                "publicKeyBase58": ...
                            },{

                            }],
                            "authentication": [{
                                "type": "ED25519SigningAuthenticationThreshold",
                                "threshold": 2,
                                "publicKey": ["#key1","#key2","#key3"]
                            }],
                            "service": [{
                              "type": "agentService",
                              "serviceEndpoint": "https://www.sovrin.org/agents"

                        }
                      }
                  }
                </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Delete (Revoke)</h3>
        <p>Deleting or revoking a verification key is not to be confused with temporary suspension or rotation. Deletion
            sets an identity's verification key to null; this permanently terminates the identity's ability to operate
            on the network because there is no key that the identity can use to authenticate itself--even to submit a
            new key rotation request. It is irreversible.</p>
         <p>Revocation may be appropriate
            when a person dies or a business is legally dissolved. It does not remove any record or history of the
            identity--it simply prevents any new history from accruing. This guarantees that
            no malicious actor can recover and reactivate an identity that's dead.</p>
        <p>The scope of deletion in Sovrin is one DID only. This does not prevent an entity from creating new DIDs;
        it simply prevents an entity from reusing the old DID that has been terminated.</p>
        <p> To revoke the document of the DID, the owner of
            the DID should send the following transaction.
            <pre>
                {
                    "submitterId": &lt;DID of the owner&gt;,
                    "signature": &lt;signature over this transaction from the DID in identifier&gt;,
                    "reqId": &lt;a nonce for this transaction&gt;,
                    "operation": {
                        "type": "NYM",
                        "did": &lt;DID whose key is being revoked&gt;,
                        "document": null
                    }
                }

        <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
        <h3>Attacks</h3>
            <p>Secure communication to the Sovrin Ledger uses <a href="http://curvezmq.org">CurveZMQ</a> to mitigate attacks like eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, impersonation, and man-in-the-middle. Any vulnerabilities in that protocol will apply to Sovrin.</p>
            <p>Sovrin uses a modified version of the Redundant Byzantinne Fault Tolerace protocol called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/wiki">Plenum</a> to reach consensus.</p>

        <p>Sovrin currently stores only the following data on the ledger:
            <ul>
                <li>Public DIDs/DID Documents which includes: public keys and service endpoints</li>
                <li>Credential Schemas</li>
                <li>Credential Definitions – the use of a specific Schema, by a specific DID for the purpose of issuing credentials and a reference to a Revocation Registry</li>
                <li>Revocation Registries associated with Credential Definitions</li>
                <li>Policy Registries – used for authorizing agents and a reference to a Policy Accumulator.</li>
                <li>Policy Accumulators – proving authorizing agents in zero knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            All confidential information such as cryptographic private keys are stored with end consumers of Sovrin.
        </p>

        <h3>Residual Risks</h3>
            <p>We don't believe to have any residual risks at this time.</p>

        constitute a canonical implementation of Sovrin DIDs, and should be treated like an oracle.
